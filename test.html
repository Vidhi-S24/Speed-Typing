                <p>Typing is an essential skill in todayâ€™s digital world. Whether you're writing emails, coding, or
                    chatting online, typing quickly and accurately boosts productivity. Like any skill, it improves with
                    regular practice and consistency. As you type more, your fingers become familiar with the keyboard,
                    and your speed naturally increases. It's important to focus not only on speed but also on accuracy.
                    Fewer mistakes mean less time correcting, leading to better efficiency. Practicing with varied
                    words, including longer or unusual ones, improves muscle memory and builds confidence. Stay relaxed
                    during this typing test, focus on rhythm, and do your best throughout.</p>
